The project setup consists of the following:

Hardware Components:
- Raspberry Pico 400 Microcontroller
    The central processing unit is responsible for executing posture detection algorithms and managing communication with peripheral devices.
- USB Webcam
    Captures images of the user's sitting posture for analysis.
- Ultrasonic Sensors
    Detects the presence of users to activate the webcam and initiate posture monitoring.


Software Components:
- Mediapipe
    Utilized for posture detection, providing real-time analysis of images captured by the webcam.
- Custom Posture Detection Algorithms
    Developed and optimized for efficient execution on the Raspberry Pico, ensuring accurate posture analysis within the device's computational capabilities.
- MariaDB
    Storing of data including images and statistics
- StreamLit
    Visualisation of data stored from a single session
